First, I read about Morse code on Wikipedia to better understand the project. I searched for a Python list/dictionary with the Morse code and placed it in a separate Python file. I created two functions: one to verify if the text is valid, and the other to print the corresponding Morse code for each letter or punctuation mark.

In the end, the project felt simple, so I decided to add timing and sounds to fully simulate Morse code. I actually learned that there are Python modules for working with sounds, and I don’t think I would do anything differently—maybe just add a few more features.
